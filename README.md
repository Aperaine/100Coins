A basic platformer where you collect 100 coins

Download on aperaine.itch.io/100-coins

You roam a world of multiple biomes and aim to collect 100 coins. In your path you will find obstacles such as poison, moving platforms and slimes. 

Your goal is to traverse the map and collect the 100 coins with as little deaths and in the shortest time possible. Good Luck!
